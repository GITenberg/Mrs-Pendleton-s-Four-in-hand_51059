<p class='noindent'><img src='images/J.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='J'/>essica, her hands clenched
and teeth set, stood looking
with hard eyes at a small heap
of letters lying on the floor.
The sun, blazing through the open window,
made her blink unconsciously, and
the ocean’s deep voice rising to the Newport
sands seemed to reiterate:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Contempt! Contempt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tall, finely pointed with the indescribable
air and style of the New York
woman, she did not suggest intimate
knowledge of the word the ocean hurled
to her. In that moss-green room, with
her haughty face and clean skin, her
severe faultless gown, she rather suggested
the type to whom poets a century
hence would indite their sonnets—when
she and her kind had been set in the
frame of the past. And if her dress was
conventional, she had let imagination
play with her hair. The clear evasive
colour of flame, it was brushed down to
her neck, parted, crossed, and brought
tightly up each side of her head just
behind her ears. Meeting above her
bang, the curling ends allowed to fly
loose, it vaguely resembled Medusa’s
wreath. Her eyes were grey, the colour
of mid-ocean, calm, beneath a grey sky.
Not twenty-four, she had the repose and
“air” of one whose cradle had been
rocked by Society’s foot; and although
at this moment her pride was in the
dust, there was more anger than shame
in her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened and her hostess entered.
As Mrs. Pendleton turned slowly
and looked at her, Miss Decker gave a
little cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='insul'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i011.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0005' style='width:300px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>“‘I HAVE BEEN INSULTED.’”</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Jessica!” she said, “what is the
matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been insulted,” said Mrs. Pendleton,
deliberately. She felt a savage
pleasure in further humiliating herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Insulted! You!” Miss Decker’s
correct voice and calm brown eyes could
not have expressed more surprise and
horror if a foreign diplomatist had
snapped his fingers in the face of the
President’s wife. Even her sleek brown
hair almost quivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Mrs. Pendleton went on in the
same measured tones; “four men have
told me how much they despise me.”
She walked slowly up and down the
room. Miss Decker sank upon the divan,
incredulity, curiosity, expectation, feminine
satisfaction marching across her
face in rapid procession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have always maintained that
a married woman has a perfect right
to flirt,” continued Mrs. Pendleton.
“The more if she has married an
old man and life is somewhat of a bore.
‘Why do you marry an old man?’
snaps the virtuous world. ‘What a
contemptible creature you are to marry
for anything but love!’ it cries, as it
eats the dust at Mammon’s feet. I
married an old man because with the
wisdom of twenty, I had made up my
mind that I could never love and
that position and wealth alone made up
the sum of existence. I had more excuse
than a girl who has been always
poor, for I had never known the arithmetic
of money until my father failed,
the year before I married. People who
have never known wealth do not realise
the purely physical suffering of those
inured to luxury and suddenly bereft
of it: it makes no difference what one’s
will or strength of character is. So—I
married Mr. Pendleton. So—I
amused myself with other men. Mr.
Pendleton gave me my head, because I
kept clear of scandal: he knew my pride.
Now, if I had spent my life demoralising
myself and the society that received
me, I could not be more bitterly punished.
I suppose I deserve it. I suppose
that the married flirt is just as
poor and paltry and contemptible a
creature as the moralist and the minister
depict her. We measure morals
by results. Therefore I hold to-day
that it is the business of a lifetime to
throw stones at the married flirt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Heaven’s sake,” cried Miss
Decker, in a tone of exasperation, “stop
moralising and tell me what has happened!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember Clarence Trent,
Edward Dedham, John Severance, Norton
Boswell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I? Poor moths!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were apparently devoted to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dryly: “Apparently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long is it since Mr. Pendleton’s
death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About—he died on the sixteenth—why,
yes, it was six months yesterday
since he died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. You see these four notes
on the floor? They are four proposals—four
proposals”—and she gave
a short hard laugh through lips whose
red had suddenly faded—“from the
four men I have just mentioned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Decker gasped. “Four proposals!
Then what on earth are you
angry about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pendleton’s lip curled scornfully.
She did not condescend to answer at
once. “You are clever enough at
times,” she said coldly, after a moment.
“It is odd you cannot grasp the very
palpable fact that four proposals received
on the same day, by the same
mail, from four men who are each
other’s most intimate friends, can mean
but one thing—a practical joke. Oh!”
she cried, the jealously mastered passion
springing into her voice, “that is what
infuriates me—more even than the
insult—that they should think me
such a fool as to be so easily deceived!
O—h—h!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I remember aright,” ventured
Miss Decker, feebly, “the intimacy to
which you allude was a thing of the
past some time before you disappeared
from the world. In fact, they were not
on speaking terms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they have made it up long ago!
Don’t make any weak explanations, but
tell me how to turn the tables on them.
I would give my hair and wear a grey
wig—my complexion and paint—to
get even with them. And I will. But
how? How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paced up and down the room with
nervous steps, glancing for inspiration
from the delicate etchings on the walls to
the divan that was like a moss bank, to
the carpet that might have been a patch
of forest green, and thence to the sparkling
ocean. Miss Decker offered no
suggestions. She had perfect faith in
the genius of her friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Mrs. Pendleton paused and
turned to her hostess. The red had
come back to her curled mouth. Her
eyes were luminous, as when the sun
breaks through the grey sky and falls,
dazzling, on the waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it!” she said. “And a week
from to-day—I will keep them in suspense
that long—New York will have
no corner small enough to hold them.”</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>II</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/T.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='T'/>he hot September day was
ten hours old. The office of
the St. Christopher Club was
still deserted but for a clerk
who looked warm and sleepy. The postman
had just left a heap of letters on his
desk, and he was sorting them for their
various pigeonholes. A young man entered,
and the clerk began to turn over
the letters more rapidly. The newcomer,
tall, thin, with sharp features
and shrewd American face, had an
extremely nervous manner. As he
passed through the vestibule a clerk at
a table put a mark opposite the name
“Mr. Clarence Trent,” to indicate that
he was in the Club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any letters?” he demanded of the
office clerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man handed him two, and he
darted into the morning-room and tore
one open, letting the other fall to the
floor. He read as follows:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Mon ami!—I have but this moment
received your letter, which seems
to have been delayed. [“Of course!
Why did I not think of that?”] I say
nothing here of the happiness which
its contents have given me. Come at
once.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“Jessica Pendleton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our engagement must be a profound
secret until the year of my
mourning is over.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Trent’s drab and scanty whiskers
seemed to curl into hard knots over
the nervous facial contortion in which
he indulged. Nature being out of
material when at work upon him had
seemingly constructed his muscles from
stout twine. An inch of it joining his
nose to the upper lip, the former’s
pointed tip was wont to punctuate his
conversation and emotions with the direct
downward movement of a machine
needle puncturing cloth. He crumpled
the letter in his bony nervous fingers,
and his pale sharp grey eyes opened and
shut with sudden rapidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew I could not be mistaken,”
he thought triumphantly. “She is
mine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the vestibule another name was
checked off,—“Mr. Norton Boswell,”—and
its owner made eagerly for
the desk. His dark intellectual face
was flushed, and his sensitive mouth
twitched suddenly as the clerk handed
him a roll of Mss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that,” he said hastily.
“Give me my letters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clerk handed him several, and,
whisking them from left to right through
his impatient hands, he thrust all but one
into his pocket and walked rapidly to
the morning-room. Seating himself
before a table, he looked at the envelope
as if not daring to solve its mystery,
then hastily tore it apart.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Mon ami! [Boswell, despite his ardour,
threw a glance down a certain corridor
in his memory and thought with
kindling eyes: “Oh! with what divine
sweetness did she use to utter those
two little words!” Then he fixed his
eyes greedily on the page once more.]
I have but this moment received your
letter, which seems to have been delayed.”
[“Ah!” rapturously, the paper
dancing before his eyes, “that accounts
for it. I knew she was the most tender-hearted
creature on earth.”] “I say
nothing here of the happiness which its
contents have given me. Come at once.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“Jessica Pendleton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our engagement must be a profound
secret until the year of my mourning is
over.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Boswell, with quivering nostrils,
plunged a pen into the ink-well, and in
that quiet room two hearts thumped so
loudly that only passion and scratching
pens averted mutual and withering
contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Boswell left the office a very
young man entered it. He possessed
that nondescript blond complexion
which seems to be the uniform of the
New York youth of fashion. The
ciphers of the Four Hundred have
achieved the well-scrubbed appearance
of the Anglo-Saxon more successfully
than his accent. Mr. Dedham might
have been put through a clothes-wringer.
Even his minute and recent moustache
looked as if each hair had its particular
nurse, and his pink and chubby face
defied conscientious dissipation. He
sauntered up to the clerk’s desk with an
elaborate affectation of indifference, and
drawled a demand for his mail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clerk handed him a dainty note
sealed with a crest. He accepted it
with an absent air, although a look of
genuine boyish delight thrust its way
through the fishy inertness of his average
expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took him a minute and a half
to get into the morning-room and read
these fateful lines:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Mon ami,—[“Enchanting phrase!
I can hear her say it.”] I have
but this moment received your letter,
which seems to have been delayed.
[“Ah! this perfume! this perfume!”]
I say nothing here of the happiness
which its contents have given
me. Come at once.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“Jessica Pendleton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our engagement must be a profound
secret until the year of my mourning is
over.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A rosy tide wandered to the roots of
Mr. Dedham’s ashen locks, and he made
a wild uncertain dab at his upper lip.
Again there was no sound in the
morning-room of the St. Christopher
Club but the furious dashing of pens,
the rending of parchment paper, the
sudden scraping of a nervous foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tall broad-shouldered young man,
with much repose of face and manner,
entered the office from the avenue,
glanced at the pigeon-holes above the
clerk’s desk, then sauntered deliberately
into the morning-room and looked out
of the window. A slight rigidity of the
nostrils alone betokened the impatience
within, and his uneasy thoughts ran
somewhat as follows:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a fool I have been! After all
my experience with women to make such
an ass of myself over the veriest coquette
that ever breathed; but her preference
for me last winter was so
pointed—oh, damnation!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood gnawing his underlip at the
lumbering ’bus, but turned suddenly as
a man approached from behind and presented
several letters on a tray. The
first and only one he opened ran thus:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Mon ami!—I have but this moment
received your letter, which seems
to have been delayed. I say nothing
here of the happiness which its contents
have given me. Come at once.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“Jessica Pendleton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our engagement must be a profound
secret until the year of my mourning is
over.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Severance folded the note, his face
paling a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, she is true after all.
What a brute I was to misjudge her!”
He strolled back to the office. “I will
go home and write to her, and to-morrow
I shall see her! Great Heaven! Were
six months ever so long before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he turned from the coat-room Boswell
entered the office by the opposite
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fellow looks as gay as a lark,”
he thought. “He hasn’t looked like
that for six months. I believe I’ll make
it up with him—particularly as I’ve
come out ahead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me that package,” demanded
Boswell dreamily of the clerk. Then he
caught sight of Severance. “Why,
Jack, old fellow!” he cried, “how are
you? Haven’t seen you looking so well
for an age. Don’t go out. It’s too
hot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, hang it! I’ve got to. I’m off
for Newport to-morrow. It’s so infernally
dull in town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to Newport to-morrow! So
am I. My aunt is quite ill and has sent
for me. I’m her heir, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? Didn’t know you had an
aunt. I congratulate you. Hope she’ll
go off, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hope so. Here comes Teddy,—looks
like an elongated rubber ball. It’s
some time since I’ve seen him so buoyant.
How are you, Teddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, Norton, old boy?”
explained Dedham, rapturously. “How
glad I am to hear the old name once
more! You’ve given me the cold shoulder
of late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, my boy, you know men
will be fools occasionally. But give by-gones
the go-by. I’m going to Newport
to-morrow. Can I take any messages
to your numerous—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear boy! I’m going to Newport
to-morrow. Sea-bathing ordered by my
physician.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jove! I am in luck! Severance is
going over, too. We’ll have a jolly
time of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say so!” murmured Teddy.
“Heaven! Hello, Sev, how are you?
Didn’t see you. As long as we are all
going the same way we might as well
bury our hatchet. What do you say,
dear boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only too happy,” said Severance,
heartily. “And may we never unearth
it again. Here comes Trent. He looks
as if he had just been returned for the
Senate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you?” demanded Trent,
peremptorily. “You have made it up?
Don’t leave me out in the cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dedham made a final lunge for his
deserting dignity, then sent it on its
way. “I should think not,” he cried,
with dancing eyes. “Give me your
fist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment they were all shaking
each other’s hand off, and good-fellowship
was streaming from every eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come over to my rooms, all of you,”
gurgled Teddy, “and have a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With pleasure, my boy,” said Trent.
“But native rudeness will compel me
to drink and run. I am off for Newport—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Newport!” cried three voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; anything strange in that?
I’m going on vital business connected
with the coming election.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a coincidence!” exclaimed
Boswell, with the appreciation of the
romanticist. “Why, we are all going to
Newport. Dedham in search of health,
Severance of pleasure, and I of a fortune—only
the old mummy is always
making out her cheques, but never
passes them in. Well, I hope we’ll see
a lot of each other when we get there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course,” said Severance, hastily.
“We will have many another
game of polo together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Dedham, “come over to
my rooms now and drink to the success
of our separate quests.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/M.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='M'/>iss Decker paced restlessly
up and down the sea-room
waiting for the mail. Mrs.
Pendleton, more composed
but equally nervous, lay in a long
chair, with expectation in her eyes and
triumph on her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will they answer or will they not?”
exclaimed Miss Decker. “If the mail
would only come! Will they be crushed?—furious?—or—will
they apologise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I care nothing what they do,” said
Mrs. Pendleton, languidly. “All I
wanted was to see them when they
received my notes, and later when
they met to compare them. I hold
that my revenge is a masterpiece—to
turn the joke on them and to let
them see that they could not make a
fool of me at the same time! Oh! how
dared they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they’ll never perpetrate another
practical joke, my dear. You have your
revenge, Jessica; you have blunted their
sense of humour for life. I doubt if they
ever even read the funny page of a newspaper
again. Here comes the postman.
There! the bell has rung. Why doesn’t
Hart go? I’ll go myself in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pendleton’s nostrils dilated a
little, but she did not turn her head
even when the manservant entered and
held a silver tray before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four letters lay thereon. She placed
them on her lap but did not speak until
the man had left the room. Then she
looked at Miss Decker and gave the
letters a little sweep with the tips of
her fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have answered,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Jessica, for Heaven’s sake don’t
be so iron-bound!” cried her friend.
“Read them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can read them if you choose.
I have no interest beyond knowing that
they received mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Decker needed no second invitation.
She caught the letters from Mrs.
Pendleton’s lap and tore one of them
open. She read a few lines, then
dropped limply on a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jessica!” she whispered, with a
little agonised gasp, “listen to this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pendleton turned her eyes inquiringly,
but would not stoop to curiosity.
“Well,” she said, “I am listening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is from Mr. Trent. And—listen:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Angel! I think if you had kept me
waiting one day longer you would have
met a lunatic wandering on the Newport
cliffs. Last night I attended a primary
and made such an egregious idiot of myself
(although I was complimented later
upon my speech) that I shall never understand
why I was not hissed. But hereafter
I shall be inspired. And how you
will shine in Washington! That is the
place for our talents. After reading
your reserved yet impassioned note, I
do not feel that I can talk more
rationally upon politics than while in
suspense. What do you think I did?
I made it all up with Severance, Dedham,
and Boswell, whom I met just
after receiving it. I could afford to
forgive them. They, by the way, go
to Newport to-morrow. Farewell, most
brilliant of women, destined by Heaven
to be the wife of a diplomatist—for I
will confide to you that that is my ultimate
ambition. Until to-morrow,</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! What do you think of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pink wave had risen to Mrs. Pendleton’s
hair, then receded and broken upon
the haughty curve of her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Read the others,” she said briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! how can you be so cool?” and
Miss Decker opened another note with
trembling fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is from Norton Boswell:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“‘You once chided me for looking at
the world through grey spectacles, and
bade me always hope for the best until
the worst was decided. When you were
near to encourage me the sky was often
pink, but even the memory of the last
six months has faded before the agonised
suspense of these seven days. Oh! I
shall be an author now, if suffering is the
final lesson. But what incoherent stuff I
am writing! Loneliness and despair are
alike forgotten. I can write no more!

<p class='pindent'>“Read Severance’s,” said Jessica,
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you like that man!” exclaimed
Miss Decker. “I think he’s
a brute. But you’re in a scrape. This
is from the lordly Severance:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“‘An Englishman once said of you,
with a drawl which wound the words
about my memory—“Y-a-a-s; she flirts
on ice, so to speak.” Coldest and most
subtle of women, why did you keep me
in suspense for seven long days? Do
you think I believe that fiction of the
delayed letter? You forget that we
have met before. But why torment me?
Did I not in common decency have to
wait six months before I dared put my
fate to the test? How I counted those
days! I had a calendar and a pencil—in
short, I made a fool of myself. Now
the chess-board is between us once more:
we start on even ground; we will play a
keen and close game to the end of our
natural lives. I love you; but I know
you. I will kiss the rod—until we
marry; after that—we shall play chess.
I shall see you to-morrow.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s what I call a beast of a
man,” said Miss Decker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate him!” said Jessica, between
her teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked hard at the ocean. Under
its grey sky to-day it was the colour of
her eyes, as cold and as unfathomable.
The glittering Medusa-like ends of her
hair seemed to leap upward and writhe
at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think you would hate him,”
said Miss Decker; “he is the only living

to say. Nice little boy, Teddy:—</p>

all. But I always said you were not a
flirt. I knocked a man down once and
challenged him to a duel because he
said you were. He wouldn’t fight, but
I had the satisfaction of letting him
know what I thought of him. And now
I can prove it to all the world! But I
can’t write any more. There are three
blots on this now—the pen is jumping

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, madam, you’re in a scrape, and
I don’t envy you. What will you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pendleton pressed her head
against the back of the chair, straining
her head upward as if she wanted the
salt breeze to rasp her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been so bored for six
months,” she said slowly. “Let them
come. I will see each of them alone,
and keep the farce going for a week or
so. It will be amusing—to be engaged
to four men at once. You will command
the forces and see that they do
not meet. Of course, it cannot be kept
up very long, and when all resources
are failing I will let them meet and
make them madly jealous. It will do
one of them good, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you have courage,” ejaculated
Miss Decker. “You can’t do it. But
yes, you can. If the woman lives who
can play jackstraws with firebrands, that
woman is you. And what fun! We
are so dull here—both in mourning.
I’ll help you. I’ll carry out your instructions
like a major.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pendleton rose and walked up
and down the room once or twice.
“There is only one thing,” she said,
drawing her brows together: “if I am
engaged to them they will want to—h’m—kiss
me, you know. It will be rather
awkward. I never was engaged to any
one but Mr. Pendleton, and he used to
kiss me on my forehead and say, ‘My
dear child.’ I am afraid they won’t be
contented with that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid they won’t! But you
have tact enough. Come, say you will
do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Jessica, “I will do it. In
my boarding-school days I used to dream
of being a tragedy queen; I find myself
thrust by circumstances into comedy.
But I have no doubt it will suit my
talents better.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/S.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='S'/>everance strode impatiently
up and down the room
overlooking the ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Will be down in a minute.’ I suppose
that means the usual thirty for
reflection and contemplation of bric-à-brac.
What a pretty room! No bric-à-brac
in it, by the way. I wonder if
this is the room my lady Jessica is said
to have furnished to suit herself? It
looks like a woodland glade. She must
look stunning against those moss-green
curtains. I wonder how madam liked
my letter? It was rather brutal, but to
manage a witch you have got to be Jove
astride a high horse. Here she comes.
I know that perfume. She uses it to
sweeten the venom of those snakes of
hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pendleton entered and gave him
her hand with frank welcome. Her
“snakes” seemed vibrant with life and
defiance, and her individuality pierced
through her white conventional gown
like a solitary star in a hueless sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do?” she asked, shaking
his hand warmly; then she sat
down at once as a matter of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He understood the manœuvre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us play chess, by all means,” he
said and took a chair opposite. “Your
seclusion has done you good,” he added,
smiling as the crest of a wave appeared
in her eyes. “You have lost your
fagged look and are more like a girl
than a widow. Dissipation does not
agree with you. Two more winters!
You would try to make up for it by
your wit, and then your nose would get
sharp, and you would have a line down
the middle of your forehead and another
on each side of your mouth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are as rude as ever,” said Jessica,
coldly; but the wave in her eyes
threatened to become tidal. “If you
marry a blonde and incarcerate her,
however, you may find the effect more
bleaching than Society.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that a reflection upon my own
society? I do not incarcerate; I only
warn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” said Mrs. Pendleton, significantly;
“I have occasionally got
the best of a bad bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And as you will find me the worst
in the world you are already on the
defensive,” said Severance, with a laugh.
“Come, I have not seen you for six
months, and I am hard hit. I wrote
you that I marked off each day with
a pencil—a red one at that; I bought
it for the occasion. Don’t take a base
advantage of the admission, but give
me one kind syllable. I ask for it as
humbly as a dog does for a bone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do, indeed. I began by making
disagreeable remarks about your personal
appearance, did I not? If
you will be a brute, I will be a—cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will acquit yourself with credit.
But I will not quarrel with you to-day.”
He rose suddenly and went over to her,
but she was already on her feet. She
dropped her eyes, then raised them appealingly;
but the sea was level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not kiss me,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would rather not—yet. Do you
know that I have never kissed a man—a
lover, I mean—in my life? And
this is so sudden—I would rather
wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised her hand chivalrously to
his lips. “I will wait,” he said; “but
you will wear my ring?” And he took
a circlet from his pocket and slipped it
on her finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” she said simply and
touched it with a little caressing motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped her hand and stepped
back. Miss Decker had pushed aside
the portière.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, Mr. Severance?”
she said cordially; “I did not interrupt
even to congratulate, but to take Jessica
away for a moment. My dear, your
dressmaker came down on the train
with Mr. Severance and has but a
minute. You had better go at once,
for you know her temper is not sweet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Provoking thing!” said Jessica,
with a pout. It was the fourth mood
to which she treated Severance in this
short interview, and he looked at her
with delight. “But I will get rid of
her as soon as possible. Will you excuse
me for a few moments? I will be
back in ten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dressmaker is the only tyrant to
whom I bow, the only foe before whom
I lay down my arms. Go; but come
back soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is it, and where is he?” she
whispered eagerly as they crossed the
hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Trent. He is in the library.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SCENE II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Trent was standing before a bust of
Daniel Webster, speculating upon how
his own profile would look in bronze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would have to shave off your
side-whiskers,” murmured a soft voice
behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned with a nervous start, and a
suspicion of colour appeared under his
grey skin. Mrs. Pendleton was standing
with her hands resting lightly on
the table. She smiled with saucy dignity—an
art she had brought to perfection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I give you five years,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With you to help me,” he cried
enthusiastically. “Ah! I see you now,
leaning on the arm of a foreign ambassador,
going in to some great diplomatic
dinner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is too bad, I shall have to take
the arm of a small one; you will be
but the American minister, you know.
(Great Heaven! how determined he
looks! I know he means to kiss me.
If I can only keep his ambition going.)”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be senator first, and pass a
bill placing this country on an equal
diplomatic footing with the proudest in
Europe. You will then go to your embassy
as the wife of an ambassador.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you will accomplish it; and
let it be Paris. I cannot endure to shop
anywhere else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you not tired?” she asked
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tired? I have not thought of
fatigue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day is so warm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not felt it. Jessica!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O—h—h—h!” and catching her
face convulsively in her hand, she sank
into a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it? What is it?” he cried,
hopping about her like an agitated spider,
the tip of his nose punctuating his excitement.
“What can I do? Are you ill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faintly: “Neuralgia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall I ring for? Antipyrine?
Horse-radish for your wrists? Belladonna?
What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing. Sit down and talk to me,
and perhaps it will go away. Tell me
something about yourself, and I’ll forget
it. Sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is but little to tell. I have
been busy making friends against the
next election. I have addressed several
meetings with great success. I
have every chance for the House
this time—for the Senate next term.
How’s your face?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Misery! You said that several of
my old friends came down with you.
How odd!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose they will all come to see
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m. I don’t know. Doubt if they
know you are here. I shall not tell
them. They would only be coming to
see you and getting in my way. I’ll
wait until our wedding-day approaches
and ask them to be ushers. But now,
Jessica, that you do not seem to suffer
so acutely—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Oh! (Thank Heaven, I hear
Edith.)”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trent sprang to his feet in genuine
alarm. “Dearest! Let me go for the
doctor. I cannot stand this—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Decker entered with apparent
haste, spoke to Trent, then stopped
abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jessica!” she cried. “What is the
matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My face! You know how I have
suffered—worse than ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you poor dear! She is such a
martyr, Mr. Trent, with that tooth—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neuralgia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean neuralgia! She was up
all night. But, my dear, don’t think
me a heartless fiend, but you must see
your lawyer. He is here with those
deeds for you to sign, and he says
that he must catch the train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That estate has given me so much
trouble,” murmured Mrs. Pendleton,
wretchedly; “and how can I talk
business when my head is on the
rack? I do not wish to leave Mr.
Trent so soon, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave Mr. Trent to me. I will entertain
him. I will talk to him about
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I speak to you one moment
before you go?” asked Trent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” pinching her lips with extremest
pain, “you need not mind
Edith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in the least.” He took a box
from his pocket with an air of resignation
which boded well for the trials of a
diplomatic career. “I cannot wait longer
to fetter you. You told me once that
the emerald was your favourite stone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She relaxed her lips and swept her
lashes down and up rapturously. “So
good of you to remember,” she murmured;
“it reminds me of mermaids
and things, and I love it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were always so poetical! But
where did you get that ring? I thought
you never wore rings. On your engagement
finger, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a present from grandma, and
I wear it to please her. I’ll slip it in my
pocket now—it is too large for any other
finger—and you can put yours where it
belongs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will never take it off until you
need its place for your wedding-ring?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Angel! And your face is better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but Edith is looking directly
this way.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SCENE III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pendleton entered the drawing-room
on tiptoe, with hand upraised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! the sky did not fall, and the
train did not ditch, and the lightning did
not strike, and we are neither of us dead.
And you—you look as strapping as a
West Point cadet. Fie upon your principles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a charming tirade with which
to greet an impatient lover,” cried Boswell,
with beaming face. “You are
serious, of course?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have heard the parable of a
woman’s ‘No’?” She gave both his
outstretched hands a little shake, then
retreated behind a chair and rested both
arms on its back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My anger is appeased, but I think I
am entitled to some recompense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can he mean? Would you
prefer sherry or red wine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a draught brewed upon
Olympus which the gods call nectar—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So sorry. We are just out. I gave
the last thimbleful away an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you did! May I inquire to
whom you gave it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may, indeed. And I would tell
you—could I only remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Provoking—goddess! But perhaps
you will allow me to look for myself.
Perchance I might find a drop or two
remaining. I am willing to take what
I can get and be thankful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you will never get much,” she
thought. “The dregs are always bitter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There can be no dregs to the nectar
in question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the last drop always goes to the
head. I have heard it asserted upon
authority. Think of the scandal—the
butler—oh, Heaven!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The intoxication would make me but
tread the air. I should walk right over
the butler’s head. Where did you get
that ring?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it not lovely? It was” (heaving
a profound sigh) “the last gift of
poor dear Mr. Pendleton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! Well, under the circumstances,
perhaps you will not mind removing
it and wearing that of another
unfortunate,” and he placed one knee
on the chair over which she leaned and
produced a ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. What a beauty! How
did you know that the ruby was my
favourite stone?” And she bent her
body backward, under pretence of holding
the stone up to the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you have a number of rubies
and pearls in your possession, of which
I consider myself the rightful owner.
Shall I have to call in the law to give
me mine own?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pearls are sharp, and the rubies
may be paste. I have the best of the
bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a connoisseur on the subject of
precious stones—of precious articles of
all sorts, in fact. What an outrageous
coquette you are! What is the use of
keeping a man in misery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are men always in such a
hurry? If I were a man now—and an
author—I should wait for moonlight,
waves breaking on rocks, and all the
rest of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the old property business, in
short. I am both a man and an author,
therefore I know the folly of delay in
this short life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But suppose the door should open
suddenly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been here ten minutes, and it
has not opened yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it might, you know; and the
small boys of this house are an exaggeration
of all that have gone before.
Ah! here comes some one. Sit down on
that chair instantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Decker entered and looked deprecatingly
at Boswell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have come at last,” she said.
“We were afraid something had happened
to you. I cannot help this
interruption, Jessica. Your grandmother
is here and wants to see you
immediately. She has been telegraphed
for to go to Philadelphia;
Mrs. Armstrong is very ill. I would
not keep her waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor grandma! To think of her
being obliged to go to Philadelphia in
September. Where is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the yellow reception-room. Mr.
Boswell will excuse you for a few
minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boswell bowed, his face stamped with
gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you done with the
others?” asked Jessica, as she closed
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Severance is storming up and
down the sea-room. Mr. Trent is like
a caged lion in the library; I expect
to hear a crash every minute. But both
know what lawyers and dressmakers
mean. Boswell will learn something of
grandmothers. But they are safe for
a quarter of an hour longer. Trust all
to me.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SCENE IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Dedham was sitting on the edge of
one of the reception-room chairs, locking
and unlocking his fingers until his
hands were as red as those of a son of
toil. He was nervous, happy, terrified,
annoyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That beastly porter to keep me
waiting so long for my portmanteau!”
he almost cried aloud. “What must
she think of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wicked boy!” said a voice
of gentle reproach. “What made you
so late? I was just about to send
and inquire if anything had happened
to you. But sit down. How tired you
must be! Would you like a glass of
sherry and a biscuit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing! Nothing! You know, it’s
not my fault that I’m late. My portmanteau
got mislaid and my travelling
clothes were so dusty. And you really
are glad to see me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a question! It makes me feel
young again to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young again! You!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am twenty-four, Teddy, and a
widow,” and she shook her head sadly.
“I feel fearfully old—like your mother.
I have had so much care and responsibility
in my life, and you are so careless
and debonair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll make me cry in a minute,”
said Teddy; “and I wish you wouldn’t
talk like that. You seem to put a whole
Adirondack between us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help it. Perhaps I’ll get over
it after a time. It’s so sad being mewed
up six whole months!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then marry me right off. That’s
just the point. We’ll go and travel and
have a jolly good time. That’ll brace
you up and make you feel as young as
you look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t, Teddy. I must wait a year
in common decency. Think how people
would talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let ’em. They’ll soon find something
else and forget us. Marry me
next month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next month—well—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be rather fun to be the hero
and heroine of a sensation, anyhow.
That’s what everybody’s after. You’re
just a nonentity until you’ve been black-guarded
in the papers. Whose ring is
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of Edith’s. I put it on to remember
something by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, take it off and wear this instead.
It’ll help your memory just as
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, a solitaire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you would prefer it. I know
all your tastes by instinct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do, Teddy. Coloured stones
are so tiresome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, I think your old admirer,
Severance, must be about to put himself
in silken fetters, as Boswell would say.
I caught him buying an unusually fine
sapphire in Tiffany’s yesterday. Said
it was for his sister. H’m—h’m.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! I wonder who it can be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know. Hasn’t looked at a
woman since you left. But I have a
strong suspicion that it is some one here
in Newport.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! I wonder if it can be Edith?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Decker? Sure enough. Never
seemed to pay her much attention,
though. She’s not my style; too much
like sixteen dozen other New York girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He buttoned up his coat, braced himself
against it, and gave his moustache
a frantic twist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs.—Jessica!” he ejaculated desperately,
“you are engaged to me—won’t
you—won’t you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew herself up and glanced down
upon him from her higher chair with a
look of sad disapproval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not think it of you, Teddy,”
she said. “And it is one of the things
of which I have never approved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why not?” asked Teddy, feebly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you knew me better than
to ask such a question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you are an angel—oh, hang
it! You do make me feel as if you
<span class='it'>were</span> my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, don’t be unreasonable, or I
shall believe that you are a tyrant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A tyrant? I? Horri—no, I wish
I was. What a model of propriety you
are! I never should have thought it—I
mean—darling! you were always such
a coquette, you know. Not that I ever
thought so. You know I never did—oh,
hang it all—but if I let you have
your own way in this unreasonable—I
mean this perfectly natural whim—you
might at least promise to marry me
in a month. And, indeed, I think that
if you are an angel, I am a saint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, on one condition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any! Any!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be an absolute secret until
the wedding is over. I hate congratulations,
and if we are going to have a sensation
we might as well have a good
concentrated one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with you, and I’ll never find
fault with you again. You—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Decker almost ran into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jessica!” she cried. “Oh, dear Mr.
Dedham, how are you? Jessica, mother
has one of her terrible attacks, and I
must ask you to stay with her while I
go for the doctor myself. I cannot trust
servants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go! let me go!” cried Teddy.
“I’ll bring him back in a quarter of an
hour. Who shall—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Coleman. He lives—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. Au revoir!” And the
girls were alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” exclaimed Miss Decker,
“we have got rid of him. Now for the
others. You slip upstairs, and I’ll dispose
of them one by one. You are taken
suddenly ill. Teddy will not be back
for an hour. Dr. Coleman has moved.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/A.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='A'/> lamp burned in the sea-room,
and the two girls were sitting
in their evening gowns before a
bright log fire. Miss Decker
was in white this time—an elaborate
French concoction of embroidered muslin
which made her look like an expensive
fashion plate. Jessica wore a low-cut
black crêpe, above which she rose like
carved ivory and brass. The snakes
to-night were held in place by diamond
hair-pins that glittered like baleful eyes.
In her lap sparkled four rings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall I do?” she exclaimed.
“If my life depended upon it, I could
not remember who gave me which.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us think. What sort of a stone
would a politician be most likely to
choose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pendleton laughed. “A good
idea. If couleur de rose be synonymous
with conceit, then I think the ruby must
have come from Mr. Trent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure of it. And as your author
is always in the dumps, I am certain he
takes naturally to the sapphire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the emerald—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is emblematic of your deluded
Teddy. The solitaire therefore falls
naturally to Mr. Severance. Well, now
that you have got through the first interviews
in safety, what are you going to
do next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edith, I do not know. They are all
so dreadfully in earnest that I believe
I shall finally take to my heels in down-right
terror. But no, I won’t. I’ll come
out of it with the upper hand and save
my reputation as an actress. I will keep
it up for two or three days more, but
after that it will be impossible. They
are bound to meet here sooner or later.
Thank Heaven, we are rid of them for
to-night, at least!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manservant threw back the
portière.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Trent!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavens!” cried Edith, under her
breath; “I forgot to give orders that we
were not receiv—how do you do, Mr.
Trent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And which is his ring?” Jessica
made a frenzied dab at the jewels in her
lap. She slipped the sapphire on her
finger and hid the others under a
cushion. Trent, who had been detained
a moment by Miss Decker, advanced to
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very soon to come again,” he
said, “but I simply had to call and inquire
if you felt better. I am delighted
to see that you apparently do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am better, thank you.” Her voice
was weak. “It was good of you to
come again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose ring is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—a—to—sure—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jessica!” cried Miss Decker, “have
you gone off with my ring again? You
are so absent-minded! I hunted for
that ring high and low!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should not be so good-natured,
and my memory would turn over a new
leaf. Here, take it.” She tossed the
ring to Miss Decker and raised her eyes
guiltily to Trent’s. “Shall I go up and
get the other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But I thought you promised
never to take it off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forgot that water ruins stones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it is a consolation to know that
water does not ruin a certain plain gold
circlet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Boswell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessica gasped and looked at the
flames. A crisis had come. Would
she be clever enough? Then the situation
stimulated her. She held out her
hand to Boswell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have come to see me?” she
cried delightedly. “Mr. Trent has just
been telling us that you came down with
him, and I hoped you would call soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to be sure—to be sure. You
might have known I would call soon.”
He bowed stiffly to Trent, and, seating
himself close beside Jessica, murmured
in her ear: “Cannot you get rid of that
fellow? How did he find you out so
soon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he came to see Edith, of
course. Do you not remember how
devoted he always was to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I ask what you are whispering
about, Mr. Boswell?” demanded Trent,
breaking from Miss Decker. “Is he
confiding to you the astounding success
of his last novel, Mrs. Pendleton? Or
was it a history of the United States?
I really forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the last, certainly. I leave it
to you to make history—an abridged
edition. My ambition is a more humble
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you will both need biographers,”
said Mrs. Pendleton, who was beginning
to enjoy herself. “I will give you an
idea. Join the Theosophists. Arrange
for reincarnation. Come back in the
next generation and write your own
biographies. Then your friends and
families cannot complain you have
not had justice done you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! ha!” said Trent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are as cruel as ever,” said Boswell,
with a sigh. “Where is my ring?”
he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was so large that I could not
keep it on. I must have a guard
made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear little fingers—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may never have been taught
when you were a small boy, Mr. Boswell,”
interrupted Trent, “that it is
rude to whisper in company. Therefore,
to save your manners in Mrs. Pendleton’s
eyes, I will do you the kindness
to prevent further lapse.” And he
seated himself on the other side of
Jessica and glared defiantly at Boswell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Severance and Mr. Dedham!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Severance entered hurriedly. “I am
so glad to hear—ah, Boswell! Trent!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How odd that you should all find
your way here the very first evening
of your arrival!” And Jessica held
out her hand with a placid smile. Miss
Decker was more nervous, but five
seasons were behind her. “Ah!” continued
Mrs. Pendleton, “and Mr. Dedham,
too! This is a most charming
reunion!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charming beyond expression!” said
Severance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trent and Boswell being obliged to
rise when Miss Decker went forward to
meet the newcomers, Severance took
the former’s chair, Dedham that of the
future statesman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are better?” whispered Severance.
“I have been anxious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I have been worried to death!”
murmured Teddy in her other ear.
“That wretched doctor had not only
moved but gone out of town; and when
I came back at last and found—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Severance,” exclaimed Trent,
“you have my chair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this your chair? You have good
taste. A remarkably comfortable chair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would oblige me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By keeping it? Certainly. You
were ever generous, but that I believe
is a characteristic of genius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Pendleton,” said Boswell, plaintively,
“as Mr. Dedham has taken my
chair, I will take this stool at your
feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trent was obliged to lean his elbow
on the mantelpiece, for want of a better
view of Mrs. Pendleton, and Miss
Decker sat on the other side of Dedham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, Teddy?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young and happy. You must let
me congratulate you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see you wear Severance’s ring.
Ah, Sev, did the ring suit your sister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To a T. Said it was her favourite
stone.” He stopped abruptly. “What
the deuce—” below his breath; and
Jessica whispered hurriedly:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edith was looking at it when Mr.
Trent came in, and forgot to return
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Boswell, I am sure you are
sitting on Mrs. Pendleton’s foot. By
the way, how is your aunt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead—better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder you could tear yourself
away so soon,” said Trent, viciously.
“You’d better be careful. She might
make a new will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry. I spent the happiest
fifteen minutes of my life with her this
afternoon. She promised me all.” He
turned to Severance. “You have been
breaking hearts on the beach, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which is better, at all events, than
breaking one’s head against a stone
wall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Politics brought you here, I suppose,
Mr. Trent,” interrupted Miss Decker.
“I hear you made a stirring speech the
other night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did. It was on the question of
Radicalism in the Press <span class='it'>versus</span> Civil
Service Reform. Something must be
done to revolutionise this hotbed of
iniquity, American politics. Such
principles need courage, but when the
hour comes the man must not be
wanting—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was all in the paper next
morning,” drawled Boswell. “Mrs.
Pendleton, did you receive the copy of
my new book I sent a fortnight ago?
Unlike many of my others, I had no
difficulty in disposing of it. It was
lighter, brighter, less philosophy, less—brains.
The critics understood it,
therefore they were kind. They even
said—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t quote the critics, for Heaven’s
sake,” said Severance. “It is enough
to have read them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mrs. Pendleton,” exclaimed
Teddy, “if you could have been at
the yacht race! Such excitement,
such—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To change the subject,” said Trent,
with determination in his eye, “Mrs.
Pendleton, did you receive all the
marked papers I sent you containing
my speeches, especially the one on
Jesuitism in Politics?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t bother Mrs. Pendleton with
politics!” exclaimed Boswell, whose
own egotism was kicking against its
bars. “You did not think my book
too long, did you? One purblind critic
said—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, Mrs. Pendleton,” said
Severance, rising abruptly. “Good
evening,” and he bowed to Miss
Decker and to the men. Jessica rose
suddenly and went with him to the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to walk on the cliffs—‘Forty
Steps’—at eleven to-morrow,”
she said, as she gave him her hand.
“This may be unconventional, but <span class='it'>I</span>
choose to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed over her hand. “Mrs.
Pendleton will only have set one more
fashion,” he said. “I shall be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he left the room by one door, Jessica
crossed the room and opened another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night,” she said to the astounded
company, and withdrew.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/S.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='S'/>everance sauntered up and
down the “Forty Steps,” the
repose of his bearing belying
the agitation within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why on earth doesn’t she come?”
he thought uneasily. “Can she be ill
again? She is ten minutes behind time
now. What did it mean—all those fellows
there last night? She looked like
an amused spectator at a play, and Miss
Decker was nervous, actually nervous.
Damn it! Here they all come. What
do they mean by keeping under my heels
like this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dedham, Trent, and Boswell strolled
up from various directions, and, although
each had expectation in his eye, none
looked overjoyed to see the other men.
There were four cold nods, a dead
pause, and then Teddy gave a little
cough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful after—I mean morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is indeed,” said Severance. “I
wonder you are not taking your salt-water
constitutional.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always take a walk in the morning;”
and Teddy glanced nervously over
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boswell and Trent, each with a little
missive burning his pocket, turned red,
fidgeted, glared at the ocean, and made
no remark. Severance darted a glance
at each of the three in succession, and
then looked at the ground with a contemplative
stare. At this moment Mrs.
Pendleton appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three of the men advanced to meet
her with an awkward attempt at surprise,
but she waved them back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have something to say to you,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cold languor of her face had given
place to an expression of haughty triumph.
A gleam of conscious power lay
deep in her scornful eyes. The final act
in the drama had come, and the dénouement
should be worthy of her talents.
She looked like a judge who had smiled
encouragement to a guilty defendant
only to confer the sentence of capital
punishment at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen,” she said, and even her
voice was judicatorial, “I have asked
you all to meet me here this morning”—(three
angry starts, but she went on
unmoved)—“because I came to the
conclusion last night that it is quite time
this farce should end. I am somewhat
bored myself, and I have no doubt you
are so, as well. Your joke was a clever
one, worthy of the idle days of autumn.
When I received your four proposals by
the same mail, I appreciated your wit—I
will say more, your genius—and felt
glad to do anything I could to contribute
to your amusement, especially as all the
world is away and I knew how dull you
must be. So I accepted each of you,
as you know, had four charming interviews
and one memorable one of a more
composite nature; and now that we have
all agreed that the spicy and original
little drama has run its length I take
pleasure in restoring your rings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took from her handkerchief a
beautiful little casket of blue onyx, upon
which reposed the Pendleton crest in
diamonds, touched a spring, and revealed
four rings sparkling about as
many velvet cushions. The four men
stood speechless; not one dared protest
his sincerity and see ridicule in the eyes
of his neighbour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pendleton dropped her judicial
air, and taking the ruby between her
fingers, smiled like a teacher bestowing
a prize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Boswell,” she said, “I believe
this belongs to you;” and she handed
the ring to the stupefied author. He
put it in his pocket with never a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised the emerald. “Mr. Trent,
this is yours?—or is it the sapphire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='well'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i088.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0016' style='width:300px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>“‘<span class='sc'>Well, why don’t you go?</span>’”</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The emerald,” snorted Trent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped it in his nerveless palm
with a gracious bend of the head, and
turned to Teddy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You gave me a solitaire, I remember,”
she said sweetly. “A most appropriate
gift, for it is the ideal life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy looked as if about to burst into
tears, gave her one beseeching glance,
then took his ring and strode feebly over
the cliffs. Trent and Boswell hesitated
a moment, then hurried after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jessica held the casket to Severance,
with a little outward sweep of her wrist.
He took it and, folding his arms, looked
at her steadily. A tide of angry colour
rose to her hair, then she turned her
back upon him and looking out over
the water tapped her foot on the rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you not go?” she asked. “I
hate you more than any one on earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. You love me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate you! You are a brute! The
coolest, the rudest, the most exasperating
man on—on earth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the reason you love me. My
dear Mrs. Pendleton,” he continued, taking
the ring from the casket and laying
the latter on a rock, “a woman of brains
and headstrong will—but unegoistic—likes
a brutal and masterful man. An
egoistical woman, whether she be fool
or brilliant, likes a slave. The reason is
that egoism, not being a feminine quality
primarily, but borrowed from man, places
its fair possessor outside of her sex’s
limitations and supplies her with the
satisfying simulacrum of those stronger
characteristics which she would otherwise
look for in man. You are not an
egoist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her hand and removed her
glove in spite of her resistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t struggle. You would only
look ridiculous if any one should pass.
Besides, it is useless. I am so much
stronger. I do not know or care what
really possessed you to indulge in such
a freak as to engage yourself to four
men at once,” he continued, slipping the
ring on her finger. “You had your joke,
and I hope you enjoyed it. The dénouement
was highly dramatic. As I
said, I desire no explanation, for I am
never concerned with anything but results.
And now—you are going to
marry me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not!” sobbed Jessica.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are.” He glanced about. No
one was in sight. He put his arm about
her shoulders, forcing her own to her
sides, then bent back her head and
kissed her on the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Checkmate!” he said.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>GERTRUDE ATHERTON was born in
San Francisco and received her early
education in California and Kentucky,
but her best training was in her grandfather’s
library, a collection, it is said,
of English masterpieces only, containing
no American fiction whatever. Yet Mrs.
Atherton is as thorough an American
as a niece, in the third generation, of
Benjamin Franklin should be.</p>

<p class='hang'>It seems to have been the English critics
who first recognised her originality,
power, intensity, vividness, and vitality,
but from her first book, “What Dreams
May Come,” published in 1888, her writings
have revealed the unusual combination
of brains and feeling. This gives
her work both keen, clever strength and
brilliancy of colour, developed through
years of hard work, many of which were
spent abroad, and reaching their best
manifestation in her latest fiction, the
one quality in “The Conqueror” and the
other in “The Splendid Idle Forties.”
Both of these books go to prove the
foresight of Mr. Harold Frederic, who,
shortly before his death, declared her
to be “the only woman in contemporary
literature who knew how to write a
novel,” and that her future work would
be her best. Another eminent English
critic, Dr. Robertson Nicholl, spoke for
some of the best students of modern
literature in saying:—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>“Gertrude Atherton is the ablest
woman writer of fiction now living.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>In her most notable novel, “The Conqueror,”
Gertrude Atherton has chosen
in “the true and romantic story of Alexander
Hamilton” a subject which would
have attracted few woman writers, and
has handled those parts of it with which
many men have busied their brains in
such a way that <span class='it'>The New York Times
Saturday Review</span> remarked that it</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>“Holds more romance than nine-tenths
of the imaginative fiction of the
day and more veracity than ninety-nine
hundredths of the history. She is master
of her material.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>“Certainly this country has produced no
writer who approaches Mrs. Atherton,”
says one critic, while another adds that
to have so “re-created a great man as
Mrs. Atherton has done in this novel is
to have written one’s own title to greatness.”
All alike regard it as “a thing
apart” (<span class='it'>The Critic</span>); “a remarkable production,
full of force, vigour, brains, and
insight” (<span class='it'>Boston Herald</span>); “an entrancing
book .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. brilliantly written” (<span class='it'>Glasgow
Herald</span>). “It is hardly too much to
say that she has invented a new kind of
historical novel” is the comment of the
<span class='it'>Athenæum</span> (London), with the addition
that “the experiment is a remarkable
success.”</p>

<p class='hang'>Equally strong in fascination and vigour is
“The Splendid Idle Forties,” but as far
removed from “The Conqueror” as were
the Eastern and Western seaboards of
this country in the times of which the
stories treat, “the long, drowsy, shimmering
days before the Gringo came,”
to the California of which she writes.
“Pointed, spirited, and Spanish” are
these “rich and impressive” stories;
“such as could hardly have been told
in any other country since the Bagdad
of the ‘Thousand and One Nights.’
The book is full of weird fascination,
and will add to Mrs. Atherton’s deservedly
high reputation,” says <span class='it'>The
Athenæum</span>.</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='pindent'>“In this book even more than in
her others is shown that imaginative
brilliancy so striking as to set one wondering
what is the secret of the effect.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For the rest, her charm lies in
temperament, magnetic, restless, assertive,
vivid.”—<span class='it'>Washington Times.</span></p>

</div>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'>In close relation to “The Conqueror” stands
Mrs. Atherton’s still more recent selection
of “A Few of Hamilton’s Letters,”
chosen from the great bulk of his state
papers and other letters in such a way
as to bring to the average reader the
means of estimating the personality of
this remarkable man from his own words.
Incidentally it is the surest refutation of
some of the hasty criticisms upon the
picture of him in “The Conqueror,”
where, as Mr. Le Gallienne justly observes,
“it was reserved for Mrs. Atherton
to make him really alive to the
present generation.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
